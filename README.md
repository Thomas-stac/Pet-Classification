# Pet classification using deep learning ‚Äì IRCD Shelters

## üìã Brief description and context

As part of a collaborative project with **"It's Raining Cats and Dogs" (IRCD) shelters**, I developed a deep learning model to address the challenge of animal identification. The shelters required a system capable of distinguishing between cats and dogs using images provided by volunteers. This initiative aimed to streamline the animal intake process and improve operational efficiency in shelters.

The project involved building, training, and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either cats or dogs. The solution also incorporated **transfer learning** to enhance model performance, leveraging pre-trained VGG16 weights.

This work serves as a foundation for future implementations, such as recognizing specific breeds or detecting behavioral traits, further improving the shelters' capabilities in animal management and adoption processes.
